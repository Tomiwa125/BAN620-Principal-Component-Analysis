PCA and Logistic Regression on the Dataset for Breast Cancer 



Overview 



The goal of this research is to reduce dimensionality and identify key factors by using PCA to the breast cancer dataset. As an added task, it uses logistic regression to forecast results based on PCA components. 



Python 3.x is required. The following libraries are needed: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. 



1. Clone the repository.
